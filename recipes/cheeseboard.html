        <li>Aged Gouda (preferably 2-yr)</li>

        <li>Fresh Strawberries</li>
        <li>Castelvetrano Olives</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the Cheese(s)!</li>
        <ul>
            <li><em>You'll want to make sure each type of cheese has its own shape. Try triangle wedges for the brie, artful rocks for the gouda, elongated rectangles for the cheddar, and crumbles for the blue.<em></em></li>
        </ul>
